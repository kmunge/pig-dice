#### A game of probability meant to make you think whereas having unlimited fan with your pair.

#### By **Munge Kevin Oroko**

## Description
The rules:
* For each player's round, one can roll the die as many times as they want.
* The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die.
* If a player rolls a 1 on the die, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated so far are forfeited.
* A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points.
* If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score, and the next player takes a turn.
* The first player to reach a total of 100 points wins the game and the game ends.
